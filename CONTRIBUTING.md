# Development

To make propert updates to the project the development requires a bit of setup.

## Required Dependencies

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- If on a Mac (to run the `Nuget.exe`)
  - [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) `brew install mono`

##

1. Create a folder to host multiple repositories (let's call the folder `winjs`)
2. Inside of the `winjs` root folder pull down the following projects
  - `git clone https://github.com/winjs/winjs.git`
  - `git clone https://github.com/winjs/react-winjs.git`
  - `git clone https://github.com/winjs/winjs-control-apis.git`
3. Follow each's projects setup (usually `npm install`) etc...
4. In the `winjs` proper project check out the version you want (ex: `v4.4.0`) and run a build.
5. The build should create a `winjs.d.ts` file in `/winjs/typings/winjs/winjs.d.ts`. Copy this to `/react-winjs/typings/winjs.d.ts`
6. Make sure the Grunt task `update-controls-api` has the necessary `.d.ts` files configured.
7. Run `grunt update-controls-api` in this project (`winjs-react`).
  - The above grunt task should have updated `react-winjs.js` with any updates to the necessary api. Validate that the updates are correct/proper.
8. Based on the updates above, update examples of new controls or other changes...
